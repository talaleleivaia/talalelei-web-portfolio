    title: 'Electric Soul',
    tool: 'Adobe Photoshop',
    description: 'This is a photo-manipulation project where I took an otherwise boring photo of my subject playing the piano. Through post-processing in photoshop, I was able to manipulate the shot to create a surreal connection between my subject and the instrument. This project was a part of a photography project I completed in college. I enjoyed photography at the time but felt inspired to step outside of the box and create something wild and electrifying.',

    title: 'Heart of Gold',
    tool:'Adobe Illustrator',
    description: '"Genuine gold" is the goal that BYU-Hawaii strives to produce in its students. This is the ideal that I tried to capture in this design that I was commissioned to create for the BYU-Hawaii Bookstore. I drew out the designs that are similarly used in many Polynesian tattoos on paper and then traced them using Adobe Illustrator. By mirroring the pattern I was able to use the white space to form the Heart of Gold. That was to be worn on a T-shirt over the heart.'

    title: 'T-Shirt Design',
    tool:'Adobe Illustrator',
    description: 'This t-shirt design was part of a collection of designs that the BYU-Hawaii Book Store commissioned me to create that showcased the diversity of the many nations represented at the school. The name of the school on top and the country on the bottom both surround an icon that represents the country in this case the iconography of Japan\'s flag and their island\'s geographical shape.',

    title: 'Self-Reflection',
    tool:'Adobe Photoshop',
    description: 'For my final project in my photography class in college, I decided to follow the theme of Self Reflection and the fact that we as individuals can be very picky about certain aspects of ourselves when we self-reflect. I was inspired by the style of Cubism and its obsession with the focus on particular details in the subject. By shooting various angles of the subject and using Photoshop I was able to cut bits and pieces of the whole and connect them in a way that calls attention to the features of each shot while still assembling the subject more or less as it should be.

    description: 'This is a type poster that was created by manipulating an existing typeface in Adobe Illustrator. The piece was made for a mock magazine article as a project in one of my graphic design classes in college. The magazine was aimed at horror movie fans and this is a quote from the film "It" so the poster features the iconography of the film.',

    tool:'Adobe Illustror',
